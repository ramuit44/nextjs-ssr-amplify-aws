## Deploying

### If you never used Amplify

You‚Äôll need to have the amplify [installed and configured](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install). Just follow the docs and you‚Äôll be ready to go. Or make sure you have the latest version.

### Amplify Init

```bash

‚ùØ amplify init

Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory

? Enter a name for the project pokessr

The following configuration will be applied:

Project information

| Name: pokessr

| Environment: dev

| Default editor: Visual Studio Code

| App type: javascript

| Javascript framework: react

| Source Directory Path: src

| Distribution Directory Path: build

| Build Command: npm run-script build

| Start Command: npm run-script start

? Initialize the project with the above configuration? Yes

Using default provider  awscloudformation

? Select the authentication method you want to use: AWS profile

For more information on AWS Profiles, see:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html

? Please choose the profile you want to use amplify

```

Besides the name, `pokessr`, I only choose my profile to deploy, called `amplify` but you can deploy in whatever profile you configured. I accepted all defaults. Then amplify will create your environment:

```

Adding backend environment dev to AWS Amplify Console app: d31r520fbr96mj

‚úî Successfully created initial AWS cloud resources for deployments.

‚úî Initialized provider successfully.

Initialized your environment successfully.

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!

Some next steps:

‚Äúamplify status‚Äù will show you what you‚Äôve added already and if it‚Äôs locally configured or deployed

‚Äúamplify add <category>‚Äú will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API

‚Äúamplify push‚Äù will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud

‚Äúamplify console‚Äù to open the Amplify Console and view your project status

‚Äúamplify publish‚Äù will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:

Try ‚Äúamplify add api‚Äù to create a backend API and then ‚Äúamplify publish‚Äù to deploy everything

```

What we are going to use is `hosting`.

And by zero configuration, you just need to connect your repository and the building settings will be set.

And you can always have a look at how the build is going accessing the logs in the AWS Amplify console. For our purposes, see a `Starting SSR Build` in your logs:

Then you gave to wait a couple of minutes and your application you be on your custom domain or in the generate domain of Amplify. For this demonstration my web apps is [available here](https://main.d31r520fbr96mj.amplifyapp.com/).
